# boneWidget

2.7 explanation : https://vimeo.com/184159913

----------
2.8 list of bugs/todos:

-doesn't delete old widget when replacing with a new version

Symmetrize errors:
-if the widget names end with .001 etc it will throw an error
-if no objects are selected it will throw an error

General errors:
-at the moment it will only match the bone matrix when the armature is at a scale of 1.0  This is because the old id_data used to point to the object, but now it points to the data object.
I need to think about how to solve this.

Future stuff:
-add property to be able to rotate the widgets
-add function to clear widget from bone
-add operator to show/hide the collections
-add operator that will resync the names of the wdgts to the bones
(sometimes you change them so it would be a nice feature)
-add operator to delete unused wdgts


-improve the ui

-add some default widgets
    -line, cube, plane, half cube, circle, gear, triangle
